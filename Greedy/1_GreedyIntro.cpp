So tha basic idea of the greedy is that when we are required to do something like we need to find the max elements 
or the max number in this amount something like we need to findthe max in the given restriction then we can use the

1.sort the array in the decn order so that we will get the max element 
2.initialise res=0;
3. just run the simple if else condition and then just run the loop till the restriction does not get over
