/*
The idea of backtracting is quite Intreseting and simple 
In this there is 3 steps involved-:
1.making the recursive funcion such that it has isSafe function and in this we will first-:
       1.check that path is safe (where we are standing)
       2.make the answer is 1
       3. make the recursive call for all the path/position u can go for
       4. make the answer as 0;(this is backtracking)
2. IsSafe function-in this we assure that we are standing on right path or not 



SO all the idea is that we will check the all the path that could be possible and then we will backtrack
